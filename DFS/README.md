## DFS Algorithm:

1- Create a recursive function that takes the index of a node and a visited array.
\
2- Mark the current node as visited and print the node.
\
3- Traverse all the adjacent and unmarked nodes and call the recursive function with index of adjacent node.
\
runtime: O(V+E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
